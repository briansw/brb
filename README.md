# Brb

Brb is an opinionated, light-weight framework for scaffolding an admin interface for Rails. The goal of Brb is to help generate a simple, consistent base to build more complex views using standard Rails conventions.

Brb includes authentication, [Pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit)-based authorization, and some form helpers.
